All of the rough earthyness has faded already and this shu shows great potential for further aging. This high-grade loose shu pu-erh was an exciting find. Gold needle grade generally accounts for less than 0.5% of a fermentation batch, and is usually used sparingly to smooth out blends before pressing. Finding loose gold needle grade shu pu-erh is exceedingly difficult because of this. Our Huron Gold Needle is the silkiest tea we have ever tasted. It feels at though there isn’t even tea in your mouth, and the flavors are being magically transported by a thick, weightless warm air. It floats across the tongue and down the throat on a carpet of moss, cocoa, and sweet fruit with a lasting creamy warmth in the aftertaste",

This cocoa-y indulgence is one of our most unique pu’er teas. An excellent change-up from the norm for you lovers of the shu. Pu-erh that is more lightly fermented can hardly be oversteeped in early infusions, but this tea should be approached differently. We suggesting easing in with quick infusions before experimenting with the full power of the Dark Side.",

Grown without pesticides or sprays, this is just pure, clean tea from one of the most pristine growing areas in southwest China. We carefully selected 4 sizes of expertly-crafted ripened leaf from this plantation and blended them to make a very well-balanced tea. The majority of the blend (around 70%) are smaller leaves which will give up more flavor in earlier infusions with the remaining 30% coming into play in later infusions. The result is an incredibly well-balanced tea. Rich and creamy in flavor and aroma without overbearing earthiness, this tea hits the mark and is now one of our most favorite ripe teas. And judging by our customer response, others think so too!",

As the tea begins to open in later steepings, a strong cooling eucalyptus sensation plays on the tongue with candied orange rind and green papaya. There are vegetal notes of delicate watercress. In late steepings an incredibly heady sandalwood incense flavor rises on the palate like vapor, combining with the creamy sweetness of jasmine. A sparkling texture builds up on the sides of the tongue along with a cooling cedar flavor in the chest. The sparkling continues to grow and mix with the cooling sensations until it is vaporous like fine gin with heavy juniper berry notes.",
